LFRic Apps Command Line Builds
==============================

The LFRic makefile build system is reliant on having code from both lfric_core
and lfric_apps available when launching, preventing the makefile from exporting
lfric_core as part of the build process. This introduces a circular dependency
in the makefile build system, not present when everything was on a single repo.
As the makefile system is planned to be replaced by fab, it was decided to not
spend too much effort rewriting the makefiles and instead use a wrapper script
to export lfric_core and call the make command.

The wrapper script is located at ``/build/local_build.py``. It is intended that
all command line options available in the makefile system can be used here - if
any have been missed then as it's a python file it should be easily extendable.
The script can be launched from anywhere by calling it, eg:

``./local_build.py <PROJECT>``

where ``PROJECT`` is the name of the LFRic Apps project being built, eg.
``gungho_model``. This can be an application, science or interface section,
although some of these may only contain a subset of possible make targets. The
``PROJECT`` is always required. The script has been setup to behave as the old
make system did. It will create a ``working`` and a ``bin`` dir inside the
project directory by default. Its first step is to export the lfric_core repo
and then rsync it to the working dir so that incremental builds continue to
work.

At the Met Office you will need to load the lfric environments before starting
the script.

This table lists the command line arguments available:

| ``-t --target``      | build                       | The makefile target, eg.    |
